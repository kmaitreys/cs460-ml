    "**Machine learning**, as part of the broader discipline of *artifical intelligence*, is a field of inquiry devoted to understand and build algorithms which learn from a sampled data (called the training data) in order to make predictions, generalizations and/or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. ML methods and techniques levrage data to improve performace on some set of tasks, especially where development of conventional algorithms is difficult or unfeasible to accomplish the given task."

    "**WHY**\n",
    "* *Bringing down computation time*: Ever so often, while scaling a direct analytic problem or applying it to a very large data set will yield poor computational performance when it comes to time. Machine learning does not use analytical methods but statistical methods. So we can exploit pattern in the data itself to predict the outputs and bring down computational times in heaps.\n",
    "* *New insights*: An algorithm which has learnt from the data can predict and generalize things that a normal human could not realise, because of inferior pattern recognition prowess in some cases."

    "**WHEN**\n",
    "* *When it is not possible to specify all rules*: Many human tasks (such as recognizing whether an email is spam or not spam) cannot be adequately solved using a simple (deterministic), rule-based solution. A large number of factors could influence the answer. When rules depend on too many factors and many of these rules overlap or need to be tuned very finely, it soon becomes difficult for a human to accurately code the rules. Here we can use ML.\n",
    "* *Scaling the problem*: You might be able to manually recognize a few hundred emails and decide whether they are spam or not. However, this task becomes tedious for millions of emails. For large-scale problems or when the quantity of data to anaylse is very large, ML techniques come in handy."
